# SocketIO Adapter

The socket.io-adapter is a core module of the Socket.IO library that provides the default in-memory adapter for Socket.IO. This module facilitates the communication between different Socket.IO server instances and manages the rooms and namespaces functionality. It can also be used as a base class for creating custom adapters, such as those that interface with external systems like Redis.

### Key Points

#### Default In-Memory Adapter:

The socket.io-adapter is the default adapter used by Socket.IO to manage client connections, rooms, and namespaces in memory.
It keeps track of which clients are connected to which rooms and namespaces within a single server instance.
Not Intended for End-User Usage:

This module is generally not intended to be used directly by end-users.
End-users interact with the higher-level Socket.IO API, which internally uses the adapter to manage rooms and namespaces.

#### Interface for Custom Adapters:

The socket.io-adapter can serve as a base class for developing custom adapters.
Developers can extend this class to create adapters that connect Socket.IO with other systems or services, such as socket.io-redis for Redis-based pub/sub functionality.
